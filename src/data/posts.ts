      "The companion side remembers you: your name, your mood, running jokes, the people in your life — surfaced naturally, unprompted. Each companion has its own personality and avatar, and the relationship evolves through five stages, from Stranger to Soulmate, as affection, trust, and intimacy build over time.",
      "The simulation side is further useful: Simulate mode lets you roleplay with fully custom agents (name, personality, backstory), and Storytelling mode takes one real situation and runs it through 7 different AI perspectives simultaneously — useful for rehearsing a hard conversation or just seeing an angle you missed. Voice/video calls with a live animated face, a Support mode for emotional check-ins, and a wellness layer (journaling, habits, guided breathing) round it into something built for daily use, not a one-off gimmick.",
